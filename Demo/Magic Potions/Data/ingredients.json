A phial of Acromantula venom Due to the violent and carnivorous nature of the Acromantula, the venom was virtually impossible to collect from a live specimen. The venom was therefore easier to collect after the recent death of the creature, for by then the venom would not have completely dried out compared to how it would be long after the demise, so a wizard or witch had to be swift in collecting it. Another problem was the Acromantula's cannibalism, making fresh corpses extremely hard to come by. Because of the rarity of the venom, it may have fetched up to a hundred Galleons a pint on the open market. The venom was used in potion-making, and was a known ingredient of the Armadillo Bile Mixture and the Potion of Invisibility. Acromantula Venom itself was not very potent in small doses.",

Consumption of alcohol can lower inhibitions and give one a pleasant feeling, but overuse can result in impaired judgement, poor physical coordination, slurred speech, trouble walking and vomiting, commonly referred to as \"being drunk\" or intoxicated, and continued addictive consumption may result in alcoholism. At large quantities, alcohol can be dangerous and even poisonous for the body. The beverage butterbeer might contain a slight alcoholic content and produced effects similar to intoxication in house-elves."

As the seeds were as hot as fire while still attached to the plant, they had to be first be cooled down before collecting them. The fastest way this could be done was by chilling the seeds, such as with the Freezing Spell. Alternatively, the seeds can be removed from the plant, such as with the Knockback Jinx, and would cool down after waiting a while.

However, due to its aggressive roots, the plant can still survive even in snowy conditions. The leaves had medicinal properties. When the fruit was skinned, which was actually the plant's flower and contained blossoms inside, it produced a purple liquid with potion-making properties. The Shrinking Solution,  the Elixir to Induce Euphoria, and the Thunderbrew were three potions for which Shrivelfigs were used in. The ingredient could be purchased at the Apothecary in Diagon Alley for three Galleons. Despite their healing properties, Shrivelfigs could not reverse the effects of curses.",

Spiders are known for spinning webs. The webs of the Acromantula were large and dome-shaped. Spiders of all sizes feared the Basilisk above all other things, which caused those at Hogwarts to flee into the Forbidden Forest in the 1992\u20131993 school year. Arania Exumai was the incantation for a charm that could be used to repel spiders by blasting them away, including Acromantulas.

Mr Mulpepper's Apothecary in Diagon Alley had a sign outside its door asking patrons not to inquire about it.

A typical species of Venomous Tentacula The Venomous Tentacula expelled venom from its shoots, and its spikes were deadly. Its bite was highly venomous and could easily stun or kill. Its juice was also a less than lethal poison. This dangerous plant was used for student research in Herbology classes at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and they were taught and handled practically in the sixth year. Students were permitted to swear loudly if a Tentacula tried to strangle them during lessons. The Venomous Tentacula had a giant eyeless head with fangs, though the shape of its mouth tended to vary, along with the many leaves surrounding it. It also had many large vines as appendages that acted like arms, which may or may not have also had separate heads of their own at the ends. The Severing Charm could be used to both stun the plant and sever its vines. Occasionally, aside from biting, some forms of the plant could also fire spiky spore-like balls from their mouths at their targets. The Venomous Tentacula ate Chizpurfles, spitting out the carapace of one once they had eaten it.",
